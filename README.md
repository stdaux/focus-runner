# Focus Runner
## Title: Focus Runner

## Concept:
Focus Runner is an endless runner game designed to illustrate the importance of focus and avoiding distractions while traveling on roads or footpaths. Players control a character navigating through various environments, such as city streets, sidewalks, and parks, while encountering numerous distractions and obstacles along the way.

Developed for Submission for MyGov POC on the topic of road safety and importance of focus and avoiding distraction.

## Gameplay:

### Character Control: 
Players control the character's movement by swiping left or right to switch lanes, and swiping up to jump over obstacles or gaps.
### Focus Meter: 
A focus meter is displayed on the screen, indicating the player's level of concentration. Distractions and obstacles reduce the focus meter, while successfully avoiding them replenishes it.
### Distractions: 
Various distractions appear throughout the game, such as ringing phones, loud music, barking dogs, or enticing advertisements. These distractions temporarily impair the player's focus and increase the difficulty of avoiding obstacles.
### Obstacles: 
Common obstacles found on roads and footpaths, such as pedestrians, bicycles, construction barriers, potholes, and traffic cones, challenge the player's ability to maintain focus and avoid collisions.
### Power-Ups: 
Occasionally, power-ups appear on the course, such as concentration pills or meditation icons, which boost the player's focus meter or provide temporary immunity to distractions.
### Increasing Difficulty: 
As the game progresses, the speed of the character and frequency of distractions and obstacles gradually increase, testing the player's reflexes and ability to stay focused.
### Scoring: 
Players earn points based on the distance traveled and the level of focus maintained. High scores are achieved by navigating through the environment without succumbing to distractions or collisions.
### Objective:
The primary objective of Focus Runner is to emphasize the importance of focus and concentration while traveling on roads or footpaths. By successfully avoiding distractions and obstacles, players not only progress further in the game but also internalize the message that maintaining focus leads to safer and more efficient travel in real life.

Note: This game concept serves as a proof of concept and can be further developed with additional features, levels, and challenges to enhance the gameplay experience and reinforce the core message of focus and distraction avoidance.
